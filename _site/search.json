    "text": "This blog is my transition to quarto, and a place I’ll write about topics that interest me, or things I’m learning. Check out the my about page to learn more about me.\nSome items and topics that may appear on this blog include descriptions of presentations I make, or publications I contribute to. I may also write about spatial statistics, nonlinearity, and select topics in statistical inference.\nAdditionally, I’d like to use this blog to practice programming in a more public space. I have nearly a decade of experience with R, but I’d like to improve with python, and explore popular workflows in R that I haven’t yet. So, some posts related to those topics may appear here as well.\n\n\n\nGlasgow Scotland, 1955"
