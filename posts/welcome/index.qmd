I'm starting a quarto blog! Thanks for reading.

This blog is my transition to quarto, and a place I'll write about topics that interest me, or things I'm learning. Check out the my [about](https://duncanjmayer.netlify.app/about.html) page to learn more about me.

Some items and topics that may appear on this blog include descriptions of presentations I make, or publications I contribute to. I may also write about spatial statistics, nonlinearity, and select topics in statistical inference.

Additionally, I'd like to use this blog to practice programming in a more public space. I have nearly a decade of experience with R, but I'd like to improve with python, and explore popular workflows in R that I haven't yet. So, some posts related to those topics may appear here as well.
