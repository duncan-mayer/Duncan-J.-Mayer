I'm Duncan J. Mayer, a data scientist with extensive experience using data to predict and understand complex behavior and phenomenon. I maintain good coding practices and am comfortable building, evaluating, and interpreting everything from well known algorithms to bespoke models. I have applied methods across topical areas across health and human services, and bring domain expertise in organizational theory, data use, as well as program and policy evaluation. I have produced research for academic, government, and private sector stakeholders.	

I'm a health statistician at [BeVera Solutions](https://www.beverasolutions.com/) where I work with the Center for Disease Control's [NCIRD](https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/index.html) and recently defended my PhD with the [Center on Poverty and Community Development in the Jack Joesph, and Morton Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences at Case Western Reserve University](https://case.edu/socialwork/povertycenter/)
