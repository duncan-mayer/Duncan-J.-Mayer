I'm Duncan J. Mayer, I am social scientist with over 6 years of experience using rigorous research and evaluation methods to understand programs, policies, and behaviors. I have experience designing and leading projects with academic, government, and private sector stakeholders, in research, consulting, and technical assistance in such areas as child welfare and health, workforce and community development, and capacity building. I maintain good coding practices and am comfortable building, evaluating, and interpreting everything from well known algorithms to bespoke models.
