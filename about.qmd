I'm Duncan J. Mayer, a data scientist with nearly a decade of experience using data to predict and understand complex behavior and phenomenon. I maintain good coding practices and am comfortable building, evaluating, and interpreting everything from well known algorithms to bespoke models. In addition to my methodological work, I bring domain expertise in organizational theory and have published articles on nonprofit finance, data use, and neighborhood effects.

I'm a statistician at [BeVera Solutions](https://www.beverasolutions.com/) and a PhD candidate with the [Center on Poverty and Community Development in the Jack Joesph, and Morton Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences at Case Western Reserve University](https://case.edu/socialwork/povertycenter/)
